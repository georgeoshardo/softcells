"""
SoftCells - A soft body physics simulation library.

This package provides a comprehensive soft body physics simulation system
with features including:
- Verlet integration for stable physics
- Spring-mass systems
- Pressure-based volume preservation
- Collision detection and resolution
- Decoupled physics engine and visualization

Main Components:
- core: Basic physics components (PointMass, Spring)
- shapes: Shape implementations (Shape, CircleShape)
- simulation: Physics engine and collision handling
- visualization: Pygame-based visualization layer
- utils: Utility functions for geometry and math
- config: Configuration constants and settings
